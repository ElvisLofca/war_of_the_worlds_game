# This is a game I made as final project during a full stack course.

This project was made using [Phaser Engine](https://phaser.io/).

## How to play 

To run the project just open the root directory and run on your browser the html file. 
Have fun and I hope someone will reach level two.


## Talking voice in background

If you are hearing a voice in background it's a javascript library which tells essentially the story of the game and whats is going on.
If you notice a strange accent it may be because your browser it's in a different language rather than english.
The technology used to make a voice read your text it's [Speechsyntesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis).
